# Timely
This to-do list application is meant to simplify user task management by automatically prioritizing and sorting tasks according to their category, due date, and whether they are marked as important.
This project was highly time-consuming but informative, and I gained hands-on experience with different SwiftUI features. I especially struggled with implementing a sorting method. While the currently implemented method is not the most efficient, I will continue working on this application.

My plans include incorporating a mascot, making the application more visually appealing, and improving the user experience.

## Features
### Automatic Task Prioritization
- Tasks are sorted by category and due date, with conditional validation to convey the task's urgency
- Tasks marked as **important** are marked with a ⭐️ and prioritized over all other tasks, regardless of due date

### Task Completion
- Clicking on the task in the to-do list takes the user to a detailed view, where they can mark their task as completed
- Completed tasks are removed from the to-do list
